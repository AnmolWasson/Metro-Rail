                          ####### DELHI METRO RAIL APP  #######



This is a Java software that asks the user for information about the source station and destination station of the Delhi Metro and then displays the cost and quickest path to the destination. 

The Graph and Heap data structures are used to carry out the concept.
Edges and nodes make up the graph. Nodes stand in for individual metro stations, each of which will include information about them such as their name, metro corridor, and lines they link. The cost of each edge will be equal to the distance between its two connecting stations. Edges (the link between two nodes) reflect the distance between the two stations (nodes).

The shortest route between the source station and the destination station is found using several algorithms, including Dijkstra, breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc. The fare is then computed based on the total distance between the two stations. Finally, the total fare and the metro route between the two stations are shown.
